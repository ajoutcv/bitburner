# bitburner
This is a collection of scripts I have written for the game BitBurner.

The scripts are pretty simple in my eyes as I've been mainly using the game as a learning tool for JavaScript.

I've still got to put in some descriptive comments at the top of some of the scripts but I hope you can get the gist of what it does from the name of the script for now.

I'm planning on going through and updating stuff as I get further into the game and develop my skills a bit more.

You're welcome to give them a shot. Any feedback is very welcome!
